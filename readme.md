## About

An Implementation of the Glicko-2 rating system in typescript. The Glicko-2 rating system is a method for assessing a player's strength in games of skill, such as chess and go. The algorithm is explained by its author, Mark E. Glickman, on http://glicko.net/glicko.html.

Each player begins with a rating, a rating deviation (accuracy of the rating) and a volatility (speed of rating evolution). These values will evolve according to the outcomes of matches with other players.

This implementation is (almost) fully typed and written in typescript.
